                    <p>The best place to start my adventure in computer science would be with LSL, or Linden Scripting Language. This is a language that is inclusive to the game Second Life, which I played as a kid. It was my first ever exposure to
                    computer programming, and I consider it to be the catalyst to my interest in programming as a whole. I never learned LSL, but I always thought it was fun to play around with!</p>

                      <p>I attended Phillip O. Berry Academy of Technology in Charlotte, NC. P.O.B. was a technology magnet school, which I chose to attend for its computer science program. This is where I truly found my interest in computer programming
                      (though not yet web development). At P.O.B, not all of the computer programming classes were required for the I.T. students, but I took them anyway, and earned top scores in each of the classes. These included: VB.Net, C# (XNA framework),
                      and SAS Programming I and II. I graduated with a 4.84 weighted GPA, and earned some interesting accolades and awards while I attended. These included:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Certificate of Information Technology Studies, awarded for taking all IT classes available</li>
                          <li>SAS Certificate of Achievement, for traveling to Washington, D.C to present a SAS project at SAS Global Forum in 2014</li>
                          <li>STEM Awards for IT and STEM awards for Best of the Best, also for our SAS project</li>

                      <p>I was accepted into the University of North Carolina at Charlotte for my first semester in Fall 2014 as a Computer Science major. I intended to follow my decision to pursue programming as a career, and the location
                      of UNC Charlotte and well developed CS department led to my decision to attend. Currently I am still attending UNCC, and I plan to graduate in Spring 2018 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a concentration in Computing Systems.</br></br>
                       My major does not follow Web Development, but rather software systems development. I decided in my sophomore year that web development was my personal interest, and that I would continue the path of my major and develop as a web developer
                        as a personal goal. This way I would have multiple areas of expertise. </br>As it stands, these are my current accomplishments:
